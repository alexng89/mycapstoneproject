# Portfolio Optimization For Dummies  
As retail investors, there are lists of stocks/funds that we like to purchase in order to meet our long-term investment goals: Apple, Amazon, SPY ETF etc.  

However, we tend to make our investment decisions in isolation, often neglecting the correlations between each stock/fund bought, thereby taking on inefficient risks in our portfolio from a return/volatility standpoint. The most straightforward error a novice investor tends to make is to buy equal dollar amounts of stocks that they like (e.g. $1000 in each of the FANGMA stocks).  

The objective of this capstone project is to build an app that would help us make decisions on how to diversify/rebalance our portfolio through a portfolio simulation, so that we are able to limit the inefficient/excessive risks in our portfolio.
